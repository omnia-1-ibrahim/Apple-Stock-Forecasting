# 🍎 Apple Stock Forecasting Dashboard

Welcome to my end-to-end data science project where I:

✅ Collected Apple stock data  
✅ Built two forecasting models: Prophet & LSTM  
✅ Evaluated their performance (RMSE)  
✅ Visualized everything in an interactive Power BI dashboard  
✅ Designed the visuals inspired by Apple’s clean style 🎨

## 📈 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Forecast Apple's stock price using time series models and compare performance  
- **Models Used:**
  - [x] Prophet (by Meta)
  - [x] LSTM (Keras)
- **Visualization Tool:** Power BI  
- **Languages & Tools:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, TensorFlow, Power BI, DAX
